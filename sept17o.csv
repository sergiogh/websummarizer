https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05558v1,"Ben Barber and a team of 12 other researchers have developed a real-time, scalable, fast, and highly resource efficient decoder for quantum computers named the Collision Clustering decoder. The paper claims this decoder overcomes challenges of managing noise in quantum computers and efficiency at scale. The decoder has been implemented on FPGA and ASIC, with FPGA decoding frequency above a megahertz on an 881 qubit surface code and using only 4.5% of the available logical computation elements. The ASIC decoding frequency, on a 1057 qubit surface code, operates above a megahertz as well and consumes 8 mW of power. This decoder could potentially facilitate the realization of fault-tolerant quantum computers.",

https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.05290v1,"Alejandro Mata Ali, Iñigo Perez Delgado, Marina Ristol Roura, and Aitor Moreno Fdez. de Leceta, and Sebastián V. Romero, reportedly developed an algorithm to assist in solving systems of linear equations. The algorithm is based on the HHL methodology and introduces a new concept of qudits, a generalization of qubits with more states. The researchers aim to diminish the number of gates needed and reduce overall resource use via this quantum-inspired strategy.

https://phys.org/news/2023-09-linear-path-efficient-quantum-technologies.html,"Researchers from the University of Stuttgart, in collaboration with the Center for Integrated Quantum Science and Technology (IQST), have exceeded previously assumed upper theoretical limits in quantum computation and communication. The study, led by Prof. Stefanie Barz, explores quantum entanglement to achieve improved efficiencies. Through the use of additional photons with entangled photon pairs, doctoral researchers Matthias Bayerbach and Simone D'Aurelio achieved a 57.9% success rate in Bell-state measurements, significantly surpassing the traditionally assumed limit of 50%. This advance required the use of 48 single-photon detectors operating in near-perfect synchrony. This breakthrough has implications for areas such as long-distance quantum communication. The findings were published in the journal Science Advances.

https://www.rand.org/blog/2023/09/when-a-quantum-computer-is-able-to-break-our-encryption.html,"A breakthrough in Quantum Computing was reached on October 23, 2019, when Google announced its quantum computer solved a mathematical problem faster than any supercomputer. While this achievement is similar in importance to the Wright Brothers' first flight, pundits deem it impossible to maintain secrecy around such advancements in quantum computing, as demonstrated when the paper detailing Google's accomplishment was inadvertently posted by NASA. A significant concern in the field is around Shor's Algorithm, which could allow quantum computers to break nearly all current Internet encryption, with far-reaching consequences. Current quantum computers can't execute Shor's Algorithm efficiently and experts estimate that relevant quantum computers might only be developed by the 2030s. In response to this threat, the US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is developing post-quantum cryptography (PQC) protocols, and the US government has initiated transitioning processes to PQCs with a goal to mitigate quantum risk by 2035. Yet, experts argue that awareness about the existence of cryptanalytically relevant quantum computers (CRQCs) will define the severity of the threat they pose.",https://www.rand.org/content/rand/pubs/research_briefs/RBA2517-1/_jcr_content/par/teaser.crop.375x280.cm.jpeg/1694635897584.jpeg

https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/automotive-and-assembly/our-insights/gearing-up-for-mobilitys-future-with-quantum-computing,"Quantum computing (QC), predicted to have widespread commercial application within five to ten years, could significantly enhance the mobility sector. McKinsey analysts predict rapidly increasing demand for electric vehicles (EVs), with sales expected to grow sixfold from 2021 to 2030. Advancements in battery technology, autonomous vehicles, and a shift towards greener modes of transport factor into this prediction. Almost $280 billion has been invested in automotive hardware and software solutions since 2010. The influence of QC could enable more efficient exchanges of large datasets, enhancing real-time decision-making and overall vehicle performance. McKinsey anticipates the economic value of QC in the automotive sector could range from $29 billion to $63 billion by 2035. Essential uses of QC in this context could include optimization algorithms, simulations, and data-driven risk analysis.

The system is being trialed by Shinjae Yoo, a computational scientist at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Brookhaven National Laboratory, on the Perlmutter supercomputer using 256 NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPUs to simulate around 36 qubits. The multi-node version of PennyLane simplifies the complex task of accelerating massive quantum system simulations, making it possible for less experienced researchers to run large simulations. Yoo's work aims to advance high-energy physics and machine learning, with other researchers using quantum simulations for applications in chemistry and materials science. Xanadu's framework is also assisting companies like Rolls-Royce and Volkswagen Group in creating quantum algorithms for jet engine design and more powerful batteries for electric vehicles respectively. At the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), at least four other projects leveraging PennyLane are underway.

https://www.quantamagazine.org/machine-learning-aids-classical-modeling-of-quantum-systems-20230914/,"A new method allows classical machines to effectively model and predict quantum system behavior, potentially serving as a key advancement in the field of quantum computing. University of California, San Diego physicist Yi-Zhuang You states that this development changes the way quantum computation and machine learning are combined. Scott Aaronson, a computer scientist, proposed in 2017 that a full classical representation isn't necessary to understand a quantum system. In 2020, physicists Hsin Yuan (Robert) Huang and Richard Kueng refined this method to predict numerous characteristics of a quantum system using very few measurements. A practical approach in 2020 involved developing a ""classical shadow"" which, much like an actual shadow, presents condensed but essential information about its quantum system. Machine learning goes further to enhance this model by predicting how the quantum system changes over time. Recent research by Laura Lewis at the Simons Institute for the Theory of Computing exemplifies this, demonstrating a way to negate the increased training data requirements, making the method practically feasible.",

https://jackkrupansky.medium.com/classically-inspired-quantum-algorithms-considered-harmful-and-the-need-for-quantum-native-8e999a5b0d05,"Technology consultant and writer, Jack Krupansky, published an article on Medium where he posits that quantum programming should not rely heavily on classical programming techniques as this results in ""classically-inspired quantum algorithms"". These classically-inspired quantum algorithms, Krupansky argues, fail to fully exploit quantum parallelism which provides exponential speedup. He suggests that the future of quantum programming lies in designing original, ""quantum-native algorithms"". The article specifically mentions two main forms of classically-inspired quantum algorithms currently in use, Variational methods and Monte Carlo Simulation, asserting that these methods, while productive in classical computing, are not designed to take full advantage of quantum computing's capabilities.
