https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-023-02681-8,"The excitement about the potential world-changing properties of superconducting material LK-99 has waned after it was determined not to be a superconductor. Superconductors are materials that carry electric currents without resistance or waste heat, but currently require extremely low temperatures or high pressures. If room-temperature superconductors can be developed, they would have a significant impact on various scientific fields, particularly those requiring strong magnetic fields. Current quantum computing applications like the Large Hadron Collider at CERN in Europe use a large scale cryogenic system to keep the superconducting components close to absolute zero. Japanese physicist Yasunobu Nakamura, a co-inventor of superconducting quantum computing, explains that this is crucial as quantum calculations are extremely sensitive to thermal noise. Also, a superconductor's ability to carry certain amounts of current or be exposed to high magnetic fields is temperature dependent. Therefore, even if a room-temperature superconductor is developed, it may still need to be kept at low temperatures for certain applications. However, this room-temperature superconductor remains a necessary advancement for future technological leaps, including the development of a more powerful particle collider at CERN.","https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?iu=/285/nature.com/article&sz=728x90&c=-415139863&t=pos%3Dtop%26type%3Darticle%26artid%3Dd41586-023-02681-8%26doi%3D10.1038/d41586-023-02681-8%26subjmeta%3D119,419,559,639,703,706,766%26kwrd%3DCondensed-matter+physics,Particle+physics,Technology"

Ramy Shelbaya, CEO of Quantum Dice, emphasized the role of Quantum Random Number Generators (QRNGs) in bolstering cybersecurity, given the stochastic nature of quantum computers. Randomness is crucial to encryption as it makes keys harder to hack or predict, offering robust security. Regular cybersecurity systems, however, fail to achieve verifiable randomness due to their reliance on classical computing processors. Quantum mechanics can enable true randomness by leveraging the unpredictable nature of measurements like spin of electrons or perception of photons. Quantum Dice offers QRNGs featuring a unique Device Independent Self-Certification (DISC), offering continuous security checks to ensure random number generation.

https://www.innovationnewsnetwork.com/how-quantum-computing-will-revolutionise-future-financial-modelling/37019/,"Quantum computing is rapidly moving from the realm of theoretical physics and science fiction to practical application, including use in robust financial modelling. This technology is viewed as a game changer for simulating market behaviors and optimising investment strategies, a field where traditional computational methods have sometimes struggled due to its complexity. The potential of quantum mechanics is seen in theoretical concepts like wave-particle duality, quantum superposition, and quantum entanglement, suggesting new pathways for advanced computational methodologies.

However, integrating quantum computing into the financial sector is not without challenges. Legacy systems' inefficiency and the inherent restrictions of sequential data processing in traditional computational methods -- bottlenecks that hamper system performance -- must be overcome. Also, quantum mechanics itself presents mind-bending paradoxes, such as particles existing simultaneously in multiple states.

The future of quantum computing in finance will not only impact financial markets, but will invite ethical considerations. These may stem from the ability of quantum particles to transmit information instantaneously regardless of distance, potentially transforming how financial information is shared. The industry anticipates a redesigned financial modelling landscape with the integration of quantum mechanics, marking a considerable shift from classical mechanics.
