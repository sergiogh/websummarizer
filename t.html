    <div><h3><a href='https://www.btq.com/blog/difference-between-cryptography-post-quantum-cryptography'>What’s the Difference Between Today’s Cryptography and Post-Quantum Cryptography?</a></h3>
    <p>The rise of quantum computing is expected to disrupt online security, leading to the development of Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC), a next-gen security scheme resilient to even highly powerful quantum computers. The current encryption algorithms, RSA and Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), secure most of the digital world. However, Shor's algorithm, capable of running on quantum computers, could quickly deconstruct RSA and ECC, endangering these encryption methods' security. Experts estimate that a quantum computer could break a 2048-bit RSA key, which would take a billion years with a classical computer, in just 100 seconds. To counter these potential threats, scientists and engineers are developing post-quantum cryptographic algorithms like lattice-based cryptography, code-based cryptography, hash-based cryptography, and multivariate cryptography. They are focusing on developing encryption methods robust enough to thwart the computational superiority of quantum computers.</p>

    <p>Researchers at JILA, a joint institute of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the University of Colorado Boulder, have developed new "spin-squeezing" techniques that improve the precision of quantum measurements. By enabling atoms to work more effectively in groups - "entangling" them - these methods reduce quantum noise and expedite results. The team conducted an experiment with 51 calcium ions and used lasers and external magnetic fields to create a special entangled "cat state". This is crucial for measurement science, as Ana Maria Rey, a theoretical physicist and JILA/NIST Fellow, explained: "Entanglement is the holy grail of measurement science". Another experiment involved using 140 strontium atoms, resulting in improved precision below the standard quantum limit. These techniques could significantly impact quantum sensors, atomic clocks and fundamental physics tests.</p>

    <p>Scientists, led by Yang Wang and Ben Criger, have successfully implemented a fault-tolerant one-bit addition quantum algorithm on the Quantinuum H1-1 quantum computer using the [[8,3,2]] colour code. This method, based on stabilizer codes, has proved to be superior in suppressing error rates in quantum calculations. It reduces the number of error-prone two-qubit gates and measurements to 36 whilst bypassing the need for intricate error correction methods. Errors were recorded at a rate of ~1.1 x 10^-3 for the fault-tolerant circuit, a marked improvement compared to 9.5 x 10^-3 for the unencoded circuit. This advancement significantly lessens the overhead, making near-term implementation feasible. The key takeaway: smart quantum algorithms can drive effective fault mitigation in quantum computing.

    <p>In a recent technological experiment, David Morcuende used IBM's Qiskit and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to solve a Sudoku puzzle. Sudoku's complexity was characterized as a coloring problem, critical for QAOA applicability. By treating the grids as nodes and considering rules as edges, tasks were translated into QUBO (Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization), a recognizable format for the quantum computers. Constraints for Sudoku were then designed to generate the QUBO representation. Morcuende utilized the QAOA, a quantum algorithm that approximates solutions to combinatorial optimization problems, to navigate the massive solution space of Sudoku. Finally, the COBYLA optimizer was employed, a gradientless optimizer perfectly suited for quantum computations. It showcases the potential of quantum computing in solving optimization problems, emphasizing the power and finesse demonstrated by Qiskit and QAOA in tackling intricate tasks.</p>

    <p>MIT Lincoln Laboratory's Optical and Quantum Communications Technology Group is tackling the challenge of networking delicate quantum systems. Quantum information bits (qubits) are known to degrade over distances, making their transfer similar to a distorted game of telephone. Quantum computing chips currently hold approximately 100 qubits, yet to achieve true quantum computation breakthrough, billions of qubits are needed. As a solution, researchers propose interconnecting quantum chips. Moreover, quantum sensors sharing quantum information could enhance precision in locating radio-frequency emission sources. Space and defense agencies express interest, hoping to leverage the technology for satellite-based position, navigation, and timing systems. The identified roadblock is that qubits cannot be copied without damaging their quantum state, hence the exploration of quantum repeaters, which tackle this challenge by leveraging quantum entanglement. However, development progress is limited as a fully functional quantum repeater has not yet been realized.</p>
