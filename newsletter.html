Preskill stressed that while NISQ technology has scientific value, it currently lacks commercial value due to noise and the absence of error correction. A recent survey of over 300 pages on quantum computing applications provided sobering estimates of end-to-end run times for various quantum algorithms. Preskill highlighted the need for quantum error correction to achieve quantum value, which requires better two-qubit gate fidelities, more physical qubits, and robust systems to control those qubits. He also noted promising developments in erasure conversion, biased noise, and more efficient quantum codes.

The studies involved cooling molecules of calcium fluoride to near absolute zero and using laser techniques to control their rotation, representing the binary states of a qubit. Rigetti Computing has launched its 9-qubit Novera Quantum Processing Unit (QPU) for direct sale to researchers, hinting at an emerging merchant QPU market. Meanwhile, Google has reported an exponential speedup in simulating classical dynamics of coupled oscillators using a new quantum algorithm. The quantum landscape continues to evolve, with advancements in qubit technology, quantum hardware, and algorithm development.</p><p><a href='https://www.hpcwire.com/2023/12/11/qubit-roundup-quantum-zoo-grows-rigettis-qpu-play-googles-new-algorithm-queras-ec-advance-and-more/'>https://www.hpcwire.com/2023/12/11/qubit-roundup-quantum-zoo-grows-rigettis-qpu-play-googles-new-algorithm-queras-ec-advance-and-more/</a></p></div><div><h3><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09121v1'>Title:Does provable absence of barren plateaus imply classical simulability? Or, why we need to rethink variational quantum computing</a></h3><p>A team of researchers, led by M. Cerezo, have raised questions about the classical simulability of quantum models that lack 'barren plateaus'. The study presents strong evidence that models with provable absence of barren plateaus can be classically simulated, given some initial data collection from quantum devices. The researchers argue that current solutions to barren plateaus, a problem resulting from the curse of dimensionality, tend to encode the problem into classically simulable subspaces. This casts doubt on the non-classicality of parametrized quantum circuits for barren plateau-free landscapes and their superpolynomial advantages. The team highlights the need for rethinking variational quantum computing and identifies new opportunities for exploration.</p><p><a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09121v1'>https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.09121v1</a></p></div><div><h3><a href='https://twitter.com/MvsCerezo/status/1735476510595731755?t=p5NnXXEmKRjHwDgYYNJi7g&s=09'>This browser is no longer supported.</a></h3><p>The text does not provide any specific information related to quantum computing, people, key numbers, scientific findings, institutions, or companies.

The team created nanosized structures of the two materials on a single chip, achieving a 92% transfer of light between them. This result highlights the materials' effectiveness in quantum devices. The team also developed a new chip to support a stable stationary qubit, essential for reliable quantum networks. Diamonds, with their easily manipulable molecular structure, are ideal for supporting stationary qubits, while lithium niobate's properties allow for frequency modulation of light. This combination could revolutionize quantum information processing.

Rajaratnam School of International Studies, NTU, debunk the myth of "unhackable" quantum communication. They highlight the limitations of quantum communication despite its theoretical advantages over traditional encryption methods. Quantum communication and post-quantum cryptography (PQC) are two ways to guard against potential quantum computer attacks. Countries like China, the UK, Ireland, and Singapore are investing in quantum communication infrastructure, with China launching a quantum communication satellite in 2016 and Singapore initiating the National Quantum-Safe Network Plus. However, Krelina and Harjani emphasize the need for countermeasures to overcome quantum communication limitations. The narrative of invulnerability surrounding quantum communication requires careful reconsideration.</p><p><a href='https://www.rsis.edu.sg/rsis-publication/idss/ip23089-unhackable-quantum-communication-is-a-myth/'>https://www.rsis.edu.sg/rsis-publication/idss/ip23089-unhackable-quantum-communication-is-a-myth/</a></p></div>
